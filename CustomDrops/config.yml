# Below is an example if you would like to set a drop that is dropped on event to every mob or block. This will only
# work if there is not a dedicated custom drop for the specified entity. As that will always take #1 priority.
#
# Mobs:
#   All:
#     NaturalDrops: true
#     EXP: 10
#     '1':
#       type: GOLD_NUGGET
#       amount:
#         min: 1
#         max: 3
#       chance: 25.0
#
# Also you'll notice that at the top of each section there is a section called
# Looting, which will allow you to increase the drops when people kill the mobs
# with looting on their weapon. If you have applyToDrops set to true then when
# someone kills for example a blaze that has the following setup:
#
#  BLAZE:
#    '1':
#      type: BLAZE_ROD
#      amount:
#        min: 1
#        max: 3
#      chance: 100.0
#
# That means that whenever someone kills a blaze they'll get 1-3 drops as well as
# 2 extra drops for each level of looting on their sword.
