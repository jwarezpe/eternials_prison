# This aspect of the plugin works of the block material enum from SpigotMC. Here is a link to all possible blocks you
# can use:
# https://goo.gl/7PiB2F
#
# So for example if you wanted to make it so stone blocks drop random ores you can do the following:
# STONE:
#   '1':
#     type: IRON_INGOT
#     amount:
#       min: 1
#       max: 2
#     chance: 20.0
#   '2':
#     type: GOLD_INGOT
#     amount:
#       min: 1
#       max: 2
#     chance: 10.0
#
# This means that the Stone block when mined will drop between 1-2 iron ingots with a 20% chance as well as 1-2
# gold ingots with a 10% chance. To make it choose a random number of drops you can change the minimum and maximum
# amount of drops. If you make min and max the same it will make it set to that amount of drops every time. If you set
# the minimum amount to 0 then it will then make it so that it has a chance not to drop the item.
#
# The type of the item can be any of the examples below:
# GOLD_INGOT, 'GOLD_INGOT', 266, '266:0'
#
# However if you do something like this it will break the plugin:
# 'DYE:13'
#
# You can also set custom exp amounts to be dropped, so to do that you can add: 'EXP: (amount)' so it would look
# like this:
#
# STONE:
#   EXP: 150
#   '1':
#     type: IRON_INGOT
#     amount:
#       min: 0
#       max: 1
#     chance: 100.0
#
# If you wanted to add enchants to a custom item you can add them like this:
#
# STONE:
#   EXP: 150
#   '1':
#     type: IRON_INGOT
#     amount:
#       min: 0
#       max: 1
#     chance: 100.0
#     enchants:
#     - SHARPNESS:1
#
# Which would give those Iron Ingots Sharpness 1.
#
# To enable or disable NaturalDrops add a section under the block material, an
# example is shown below:
#
# STONE:
#   NaturalDrops: true
#
# Setting NaturalDrops to true will enable them, whereas setting it to false
# will disable them. By default if there is no setting set for any mob then
# the natural drops are enabled by default.
#
# If you'd like to give an item that has the Unbreakable tag, NOT the enchant, then you can set up a item section
# in the following way:
#
#  IRON_ORE:
#    '1':
#      type: DIAMOND_PICKAXE
#      unbreakable: true
#      amount:
#        min: 1
#        max: 1
#      chance: 10.0
#
# If you'd like to set up a custom mob head then you can set it up like the following: (Bearing in mind that once you
# have a set mob on your head you cannot set the "owner" of it anymore, like you would to specify a player's skin.)
#
#  GOLD_ORE:
#    '1':
#      type: SKULL_ITEM
#      mob: BLAZE
#      amount:
#        min: 1
#        max: 1
#      chance: 100.0
#
# Here is a list of all possible mob head types:
#
# Bat,  Blaze,  Black_Cat,  Ginger_Cat,  Siamese_Cat,  Cave_Spider,  Chicken,  Cow,  Creeper,  Charged_Creeper,  Donkey,  Elder_Guardian,  Enderman,
# Endermite,  Ender_Dragon,  Evoker,  Ghast,  Guardian,  Black_Horse,  Brown_Horse,  Chestnut_Horse,  Creamy_Horse,  Dark_Brown_Horse,  Gray_Horse,
# White_Horse,  Skeleton_Horse,  Zombie_Horse,  Husk,  Illusioner,  Iron_Golem,  Brown_Llama,  Creamy_Llama,  Gray_Llama,  White_Llama,  Magma_Cube,
# Mooshroom,  Mule,  Ocelot,  Blue_Parrot,  Cyan_Parrot,  Gray_Parrot,  Green_Parrot,  Red_Parrot,  Pig,  Polar_Bear,  Black_Rabbit,  Black_and_White_Rabbit,

# Gray_Sheep,  Green_Sheep,  Light_Blue_Sheep,  Lime_Sheep,  Magenta_Sheep,  Orange_Sheep,  Pink_Sheep,  Purple_Sheep,  Rainbow_Sheep,  Red_Sheep,  Wither,
# White_Sheep,  Yellow_Sheep,  Shulker,  Silverfish,  Skeleton,  Slime,  Snow_Golem,  Spider,  Squid,  Stray,  Vex,  Villager,  Vindicator,  Witch,
# Wild_Wolf,  Tamed_Wolf,  Zombie,  Zombie_Pigman,  Zombie_Butcher_Villager,  Zombie_Cleric_Villager,  Zombie_Farmer_Villager,  Zombie_Librarian_Villager,
# Zombie_Nitwit_Villager,  Zombie_Smith_Villager,  Fish,  Clownfish,  Salmon,  Pufferfish
#
# If you want to send a command when a block is mined then all you have to do is add a Command section to the Block section,
# for example:
#
# CustomDrops:
#   DIAMOND_ORE:
#     EXP: 150
#     NaturalDrops: true
#     '1':
#       type: DIAMOND_PICKAXE
#       amount:
#         min: 1
#         max: 1
#       chance: 0.1
#       name: '&e&lSpecial &6&lPickaxe'
#       lore:
#       - '&7You can only find this pickaxe from'
#       - '&7mining Diamond Ore. And it only has a'
#       - '&f0.1%&7 chance of dropping.'
#       enchants:
#       - 'Efficiency:7'
#       - 'Fortune:5'
#       - 'Unbreaking:4'
#     '2':
#       chance: 100.0
#       amount:
#         min: 1
#         max: 1
#       commands:
#       - 'broadcast {p} has just mined 1x Diamond!'
#       - 'msg {p} congratulations on finding 1x Diamond! :)'
#
# The way the amount works with commands is if it has a random amount, it will run the command x amount of times
# that was randomly chosen between the numbers.
