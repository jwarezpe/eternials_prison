# ==================================================================================================================== #
# This plugin works off the EntityType enum, so all valid mobs for custom mob drops can be found here:
# https://goo.gl/dzwI5Q
#
# So for example if you wanted to make it so iron golems dropped Emeralds, you would set it up like this:
# IRON_GOLEM:
#   '1':
#     type: EMERALD
#     amount:
#       min: 2
#       max: 3
#     chance: 100.0
#
# This means that the IronGolem, when killed, will drop between 2-3 emeralds with a 100%
# chance. If you want it to have the chance of dropping nothing it would look like this:
#
# IRON_GOLEM:
#   '1':
#     type: EMERALD
#     amount:
#       min: 0
#       max: 3
#     chance: 100.0
#
# This then makes it so that it will choose a random number between 0 and 3. And if it lands
# on 0 it won't drop.
#
# The type of the item can be any of the examples below:
# EMERALD, 'EMERALD', 388, '388:0'
#
# However if you do something like this it will break the plugin:
# 'DYE:13'
#
# You can also set custom exp amounts to be dropped, so to do that you can add: 'EXP: (amount)' so it would look
# like this:
#
# IRON_GOLEM:
#   EXP: 200
#   '1':
#     type: EMERALD
#     amount:
#       min: 0
#       max: 3
#     chance: 100.0
#
# If you wanted to add enchants to a custom item you can add them like this:
#
# IRON_GOLEM:
#   EXP: 200
#   '1':
#     type: EMERALD
#     amount:
#       min: 0
#       max: 3
#     chance: 100.0
#     enchants:
#     - PROTECTION_ENVIRONMENTAL:4
#
# Which would give those Emeralds Protection 4. However make sure that the
# names of the enchants you use are the same from this link:
# https://goo.gl/wmJmbP
#
# To enable or disable NaturalDrops add a section under the entity type, an
# example is shown below:
#
# PIG:
#   NaturalDrops: true
#
# Setting NaturalDrops to true will enable them, whereas setting it to false
# will disable them. By default if there is no setting set for any mob then
# the natural drops are enabled by default.
#
# Also you'll notice that at the top of the config there is a section called
# Looting, which will allow you to increase the drops when people kill the mobs
# with looting on their weapon. If you have applyToDrops set to true then when
# someone kills for example a blaze that has the following setup:
#
#  BLAZE:
#    '1':
#      type: BLAZE_ROD
#      amount:
#        min: 1
#        max: 3
#      chance: 100.0
#
# That means that whenever someone kills a blaze they'll get 1-3 drops as well as
# 2 extra drops for each level of looting on their sword.
#
# If you'd like to give an item that has the Unbreakable tag, NOT the enchant, then you can set up a item section
# in the following way:
#
#  BLAZE:
#    '1':
#      type: DIAMOND_PICKAXE
#      unbreakable: true
#      amount:
#        min: 1
#        max: 1
#      chance: 100.0
#
# Here is a list of all possible mob head types:
#
# Bat,  Blaze,  Black_Cat,  Ginger_Cat,  Siamese_Cat,  Cave_Spider,  Chicken,  Cow,  Creeper,  Charged_Creeper,  Donkey,  Elder_Guardian,  Enderman,
# Endermite,  Ender_Dragon,  Evoker,  Ghast,  Guardian,  Black_Horse,  Brown_Horse,  Chestnut_Horse,  Creamy_Horse,  Dark_Brown_Horse,  Gray_Horse,
# White_Horse,  Skeleton_Horse,  Zombie_Horse,  Husk,  Illusioner,  Iron_Golem,  Brown_Llama,  Creamy_Llama,  Gray_Llama,  White_Llama,  Magma_Cube,
# Mooshroom,  Mule,  Ocelot,  Blue_Parrot,  Cyan_Parrot,  Gray_Parrot,  Green_Parrot,  Red_Parrot,  Pig,  Polar_Bear,  Black_Rabbit,  Black_and_White_Rabbit,
# Brown_Rabbit,  Gold_Rabbit,  Salt_and_Pepper_Rabbit,  The_Killer_Bunny,  White_Rabbit,  Black_Sheep,  Blue_Sheep,  Brown_Sheep,  Cyan_Sheep,  Silver_Sheep,
# Gray_Sheep,  Green_Sheep,  Light_Blue_Sheep,  Lime_Sheep,  Magenta_Sheep,  Orange_Sheep,  Pink_Sheep,  Purple_Sheep,  Rainbow_Sheep,  Red_Sheep,  Wither,
# White_Sheep,  Yellow_Sheep,  Shulker,  Silverfish,  Skeleton,  Slime,  Snow_Golem,  Spider,  Squid,  Stray,  Vex,  Villager,  Vindicator,  Witch,
# Wild_Wolf,  Tamed_Wolf,  Zombie,  Zombie_Pigman,  Zombie_Butcher_Villager,  Zombie_Cleric_Villager,  Zombie_Farmer_Villager,  Zombie_Librarian_Villager,
# Zombie_Nitwit_Villager,  Zombie_Smith_Villager,  Fish,  Clownfish,  Salmon,  Pufferfish
#
# If you want to send a command when a mob is killed then all you have to do is add a Command section to the mob section,
# for example:
#
# CustomDrops:
#   ZOMBIE:
#     EXP: 10
#     NaturalDrops: true
#     '1':
#       chance: 5.0
#       amount:
#         min: 1
#         max: 2
#       commands:
#       - 'give {p} diamond_sword 1'
#       - 'msg {p} Congratulations on winning a diamond sword with a 5% chance from killing a Zombie!'
#
# The way the amount works with commands is if it has a random amount, it will run the command x amount of times
# that was randomly chosen between the numbers.
